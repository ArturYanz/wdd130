            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Our company was founded in 1999, when a group of friends passionate about the rivers of southern Chile
                decided to turn their love for adventure into a real project. It all began with a single raft, a lot of
                enthusiasm, and the dream of sharing the excitement of rafting with people from all around the world.
            </p>
            <p>Over time, and thanks to our commitment to safety, nature and delivering unforguetable experiences,
                the company grew. We went from offering small local trips to becoming one of the leading adventure
                tourism references in the region. Each of our guides is certified and has years of experience navigating
                rapids
                of all levels.</p>
            <p>Today, after more than two decades, we remain true to our original purpose: To provide unforguettable
                adventures while respecting the enviroment and creating lifelong memories!
            </p>
